The eternal battle between waters and dry lands rages on - pushing and pulling, guided by moon and sun. Waves shift directions, sometimes breaching the shores' ancient boundaries, flooding past God-drawn lines. In their wake follows destruction and despair. How marvelous yet terrible is nature's raw power. No guilt or shame can command the flood to retreat to its borders.

"For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you want." (Galatians 5:17, NIV)

Though the waters eventually recede, they leave devastation behind. How can the survivors tend to their wounded? How can they rebuild their homes when years of blood and sweat invested in those walls have been reduced to rubble in mere moments? How do I justify my efforts and hard work to the Creator who blessed these walls and doors with grace and mercy? Why does the Creator allow this? Why doesn't He intervene?

The fish mock my misfortune, the animals remain indifferent, and the birds circle overhead seeking prey. How can I question the Creator, even knowing He is all-powerful and all-seeing? Life, it seems, has momentarily lost its meaning.
