The year started with such promise – high hopes and fresh energy for new beginnings. Yet Delhi's winter has other ideas, with its bone-chilling cold that makes you want to hibernate, even with a good heater running. It's the kind of weather that beckons you to stay wrapped in blankets all day.

This week has been a study in contrasts. On one hand, I achieved some personal goals that had long eluded me. On the other, I spent countless hours in cozy hibernation. Then today, unexpected bad news threw me off balance. But isn't that just how life works?

As a Christian, I find myself anchored by an everlasting hope. Recently, I encountered a profound thought that resonated deeply with me: "The same world that praised Jesus for all the good things was the same world that crucified Him on the cross too." This statement struck a chord because it perfectly captures the fickleness of worldly approval – how quickly support can turn to abandonment.

Perhaps I've been building castles on my own terms, while God has different blueprints for my life. Maybe He's pruning my tree as I strive to make my mark on the world – carefully grafting, cutting away the excess, refactoring the old, and strengthening my inner being.

When the bad news hit, I found strength in an unexpected place. The ease with which I could move forward surprised me, but it shouldn't have. After all, my hope isn't built on shifting sands of personal plans, but on Christ, my solid rock.
